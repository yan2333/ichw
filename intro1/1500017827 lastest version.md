1. Because 256 = 2^8
so v = 8000/s × 8 Bit = 64000 Bit/s

2. It depends on the MAX image resolution of the picture and the output dpi.
For example, If you have a picture that has a resolution of 4536×3024 and print as 200dpi, 
you can get a 24” picture.

3. That number makes up by 3 parts: sign(1 Bit)+exponent(6 Bit)+fraction(9 Bit);
±0 = * 000000 000000000;
±1.0 = * 011111 000000000;
abs[最大非规范化数] = 0 000000 111111111;
abs[最小非规范化数] = 0 000000 000000001;
abs[最大规范化浮点数] = 0 111110 111111111;
abs[最小规范化浮点数] = 0 000001 000000000;
±∞ = * 111111 000000000;
NaN = * 111111 000000001.
